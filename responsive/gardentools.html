            <p>Use: Also known as Secateurs, these are designed for trimming and shaping plants, cutting back dead growth, and harvesting fruits or flowers. Pruning is essential for 
                maintaining healthy plants. Pruning is an essential task for any gardener. It helps to maintain a plant’s shape, promote healthy growth, and remove dead or diseased branches. 
                However, using the wrong tool can lead to imprecise cuts that damage the plant. That’s where pruning shears come in. Pruning shears are handheld tools that are designed to make 
                precise cuts on small branches and stems. When it comes to pruning shears, there are two primary types: anvil and bypass. Anvil pruning shears have a straight blade that cuts 
                down onto a flat edge, while bypass pruning shears have two curved blades that bypass each other like scissors. Bypass pruning shears are generally considered to be the better 
                option for precise cuts because they create a clean cut without crushing the stem.When choosing the best pruning shears for precise cuts, there are a few critical things to consider. 
                The first is the size of the blades. Longer blades can make it easier to reach into tight spots, but shorter blades are often more precise. The second is the quality of the blades. 
                Dull blades will crush the stem rather than making a clean cut, so it’s important to choose pruning shears with sharp blades. Finally, the ergonomics of the pruning shears are essential. 
                Comfortable handles that fit well in your hand will reduce hand fatigue and make it easier to make precise cuts.  </p>
