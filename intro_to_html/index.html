        <h1>Gardening Made Easy</h1>
        <p>Gardening doesn't have to be difficult or costly. You don't need fancy fertilizers, or the most expensive soil. You don't need farming equipment to build a luxury, 
        backyard kitchen garden, and I am gonna give you all the tools you need right here.First thing you will want to do is make a few decisions. You want to decide what
        you want to grow. You will want to determine which area in your backyard gets the most sunslight. Most plants require a certain amount of sunlight, or a minimum
        of sunlight hours the plants you grow will need to thrive. Once you have established which area gets the most sun exposure, we can move on to actually designing and 
        planning your gardening space. Once you have the location of your garden selected you can start to design the layout of the space you will use. This will include determining
        where you will plant each plant or seed to determine where the best yield will have the best conditions to perform in. Lets pause for a moment. I know I said a lot in the
        first few sentences there and it may seem overwhelming, but i assure you it is easier than it sounds. Gardening does not have to be hard or difficult, and it doesn't have to
        be so cost consuming that it scares you away. In the next section we will break this down a bit more to get to the fun stuff.</p>
        <h2>Tools for Success</h2>
        <p>First you will take your list of items you have chosen to grow. After compiling this list you will need to locate the seeds or plants that you will be planting.
            The second task you will complete is to shop for those items. Whether it is seeds to start your plants or plants already established, you will want to be sure 
            that you have all you need. Nothing worse than going to sow tomato seeds, only to realize you don't have any tomato seeds. So we will compile our list of what we would
            like to grow. Once you have your seeds or plants to start with, the fun really begins.</p>
